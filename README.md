This is the first MSR-app that I have been working on before I had decided to use an online tool known as Glide. This app have a working pdf2html.js, PDFMake packages and servable via localhost. This app is only functional on a computer only since the app was not able to install filesystem packages that can be utilised for the Android version of the app due to dependency error and it needs lower version of some pacakges to make it work. The constant downgrading and upgrading which eventually cause the ionic app unable to serve or generate an APK makes me rely of Glide app.

The idea of this app is, it should be capabe to capture any user input and relay the input on an HTML page which will eventually be converted to PDF. The app should be able to show the lists of items being added into the list.

Note: This app will not be maintained.
